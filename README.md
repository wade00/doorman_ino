Repo for the Particle Photo portion of the Doorman App.

This is a test project that uses a light sensor to determine whether the company bathroom is occupied. It makes use of the [Arduino Uno](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardUno), the Adadafruit [GA1A12S202](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1384) light sensor and the [Particle Photon](https://www.particle.io/products/hardware/photon-wifi-dev-kit).
